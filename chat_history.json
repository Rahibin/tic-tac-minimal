It will handle user interactions (taps on the board) and update the board state.\n    -   `components/ModeSelection.tsx`: This component will present the user with the option to play against the computer or another human.\n2.  **Create screens:**\n    -   `app/index.tsx`: Modify the existing home screen to include a button that navigates to the `ModeSelection` screen.\n    -   `app/game.tsx`: Create a new screen that renders the `TicTacToeBoard` component. This screen will also contain the game logic.\n3.  **Implement Game Logic:**\n    -   Within `app/game.tsx`, implement the core Tic Tac Toe game logic. This includes:\n        -   Tracking the board state (which cells are occupied by which player).\n        -   Validating player moves.\n        -   Checking for a win condition after each move.\n        -   Detecting a draw.\n    -   Implement the \"vs Computer\" AI. A simple approach would be to have the computer choose a random available cell. More advanced AI could be implemented later.\n4.  **Implement Navigation:**\n    -   Use `expo-router` to navigate between the `ModeSelection` screen and the `Game` screen.\n5.  **Styling:**\n    -   Create a `styles/ticTacToeStyles.ts` file to hold the styles for the Tic Tac Toe board and other related components. This will help keep the code organized and maintainable.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-29T03:58:31.919126"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a minimalist Tic Tac Toe app with both vs Computer and vs Human modes.
